# Porcupad
A Hackpad project you probably shouldn't touch

Life is convient and everyone is constantly looking for ways to make it even easier it's too good too free too nice... it need to stop.

so i made a macropad that makes your life harder :) divided int 3 layers each gets increasingly more annoying until the last layer which i recommend you never use someone once told me the keyboard is the most trusted device on the computer so i thought of how that trust can be abused
